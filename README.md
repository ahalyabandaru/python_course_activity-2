python course activity-2

2.(a) Python program allows user to enter the total number of rows.
 Next, we used Python Nested For Loop to print Floyd's Triangle pattern
 of numbers from 1 to user-specified rows.
 
 
 (b) We are making x number of pebble heaps. The first heap has x pebbles. 
 If x is even, then all heaps have an even number of pebbles. If x is odd, 
 all heap have an odd number of pebbles.Each heap must have more pebbles than 
 the previous heap but as few as possible. Write a Python program to find 
 the number of pebbles in each heap.


3.(a) Write a function "remove duplicates" which takes a string argument and 
 returns a string which is the same as the argument except only the first 
 occurrence of each letter is present. Make your function case sensitive. 
 

 (b) Write a function mult lists(a, b) that 
 takes two lists of numbers of the same length, and returns the sum of the
 products of the corresponding elements of each.
 

 (c) Write a function called flatten list that takes as input a list which may be
 nested, and returns a non-nested list with all the elements of the input list.


4.(a) Write a Python Program to Print Pyramid Star Pattern using a for loop up
 to given number of rows. This Python example uses multiple for loop nested 
  inside another print the Pyramid pattern 
 

 (b) Write a Python program to determine the direction 
 ('increasing' or 'decreas monotonic sequence numbers.
